# Order-and-Chaos-Online
A version of the tabletop game Order and Chaos for online play built using the Serverless Framework

[Order and Chaos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_and_Chaos) is a variant of the game tic-tac-toe. It was introduced by Stephen Sniderman in Games Magazine in 1981.

I first saw the game on tomscotts [game on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsjVfJur1ac) witch also explains the rules.
